# Accessibility statement for the HM Land Registry Design System

This accessibility statement applies to the [HM Land Registry Design System](https://hmlr-design-system.herokuapp.com/).

The website is run by the HM Land Registry. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings
- zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
- navigate most of the website using a keyboard or speech recognition software
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
- access the website using a variety of devices, screen sizes and orientations

We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand. We  only use a technical term if there are no alternative ways to describe something (without changing the meaning).

[AbilityNet](https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/) has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.

### How accessible this website is

We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:

- with an increased text size, some text 'overflows' which means that words or sentences may be cut off and unreadable
- tabbing on some pages may not be in the correct order
- when tabbing, focus may be lost

### Compliance status

The website has been tested against the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA standard.

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

### Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations

When browser text size is adjusted to 200% or ‘very large’, text ‘overflows’ which means that some words or sentences may be cut off and unreadable. This fails WCAG 2.2 Success criterion 1.4.10 (Reflow).

Some of the tabbing on the components pages is in the incorrect order. This fails WCAG 2.2 Success criterion 2.4.3 (Focus order).

When tabbing, the focus is also hidden on some pages. This fails WCAG 2.2 Success criterion 2.4.12 (Focus not obscured (enhanced)).<br></br>
